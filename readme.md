# Rest With Go
I built this app to try my hand with the Go Programming Language, especially testing it with PostgreSQL and Docker.

For now, it's a CLI app that lets you perform crud actions on a database that launches on startup. In the near future, I'm adding a basic UI to display the user table.

## Startup Guide
Clone the app using your Github, open your terminal and type `go run main.go`. Currently, it's saying the authentication is failing, we'll fix that tomorrow hopefully.
